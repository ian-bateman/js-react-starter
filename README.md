In this lab I created a simple note taking app.

The app had three main components.

A sort of 'container' component in app.js,
a NoteInput component in noteInput.js (for inputting the title of/creating new notes),
and a NoteObj component in noteObj.js (for managing the actual notes).

I rendered the noteInput and noteObj components inside the app component.

I found that creating the App and NoteInput components were relatively straightforward,
however creating the NoteObj component was a bit tricky. I found resizing the note to be particularly tricky,
but I fortunately found some help at https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/prevent-long-urls-from-breaking-out-of-container/.

It was tricky at times, but I was able to do the checklist of features successfully :)
